### Parameter notes

- __Proportion of Asymptomatic Cases__: The percentage of Covid cases that are asymptomatic
- __Proportion of Severe Cases__: The percentage of Covid cases that require hospitalisation
- __Proportion of Critical Cases__:  The percentage of Covid cases that require critical care
- __(Proportion of Mild Cases)__: Not included, but can be determined as 1-Asymptomatic-Severe-Critical
- __Infection Fatality Ratio__:  The proportion of cases that result in death
- __Transmission from Incubating Cases__:  The transmission rate from incubating patients (those in the "E" compartment) to people in the susceptible population
- __Transmission from Asymptomatic Cases__: The transmission rate from asymptomatic cases to people in the susceptible population
- __Transmission from Mild Cases__:  The transmission rate from mild cases to people in the susceptible population
- __Transmission from Severe Cases__:  The transmission rate from hospitalised cases to people in the susceptible population
- __Transmission from Critical Cases__:  The transmission rate from critical cases to people in the susceptible population
-  __Effect of Public Awareness__:  Parametrises the reduction in transmission as a result of early-epidemic behavioural changes (washing hands, working from home where possible, social distancing)
- __Effect of Full Lockdown__:  Parametrises the reduction in transmission as a result of the lockdown imposed on 23/03/2020
- __Effect of Easter Weekend__:  Parametrises the change (not necessarily a reduction) in transmission over the Easter weekend
-  __Effect of post-Easter__:  Broadly speaking, a return to 'normality' following the Easter weekend
- __Effect of loosening lockdown__: Parameterises the change in transmission in light of the partial loosening of lockdown on 01/06/2020
- __Presymptomatic Period__:  The length of time (in days) that an average case is presymptomatic
- __Incubation Period__:  The length of time (in days) that an average case is incubating (the presymptomatic period is included in this period)
- __Length of Mild Infection__: How long an average mild infection lasts, in days 
- __Length of Asymptomatic Infection__: The average length of an asymptomatic case
- __Length of ICU stay__:  The average length of ICU stay for critical cases
- __Length of Hospital Stay__:  The overall length of stay for cases requiring hospitalisation (including any time spent in ICU)
